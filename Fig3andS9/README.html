<p>Model for "Dendritic action potentials and computation in human layer 2/3 cortical neurons"
The model replicates Figure 3 and Supplementary 9.
</p>
<p>Model usage:<br/>

  This code was written in and requires NEURON (tested in version 7.4,
  7.7) which is freely available
  from <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">http://www.neuron.yale.edu</a>

  This model was run under the unix/linux and windows 10 operating system.
</p>
<p>Proceed as follows:<br/>
- Download and expand this archive and compile the mod files located in the "_mod" folder with nrnivmodl (nrnivmodl _mod/).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>run the demo for unix/linux:
x84/64/special mosinit.hoc
</li></ul>
<p>or for windows double click mosinit.hoc
</p>

Once the code is running you can select a simulation from a menu of buttons to click:<p/>

  After each simulation is run you will need to restart to generate another simulation. As examples clicking the first, second, and fith buttons quickly generates these figures:<p/>
